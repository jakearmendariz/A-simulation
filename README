# A* Simulation
Built in processing

Using A*, finds the shortest path between two nodes.
Does not cross diagnols

Instructions for use
Run shortestPath.pde
When run:
The inital path is from the top left to bottom right with a map size of 800x800 unit size of 20
To change the unit size, see aNode.pde class
To change map size see settings function of shortestPath.pde

KeyCodes: (change the mode, then click/press mouse to execute function)
a = set starting point
z = set target pos
e = erase mode
c = clear map
else = addBlock

Feel free to use this code for whatever you would like, you can give me credit but I took a lot from Sebastian Lague's A* tutorial
I will link his github and youtube tutorials
(This person coded it in C-sharp Unity instead of processing so code looks very different)
