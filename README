# A* Simulation
Built in processing

Using A*, finds the shortest path between two nodes.
Does not cross diagnols

Instructions for use
Run "shortestPath.pde"
When running:
The inital path is from the top left to bottom right
If you would like to change that is inside of setup initpath
If you would like to add obstacles, you can click individual nodes, or drag for larger areas
The path will adjust immediately

Feel free to use this code for whatever you would like, you can give me credit but I copied a lot from Sebastian Lague
I will link his github and youtube tutorials
(This person coded it in C-sharp Unity instead of processing so code looks very different)
